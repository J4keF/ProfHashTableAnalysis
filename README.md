# ProfHashTableAnalysis

A custom hash table (MyHashTable.java) to efficiently handle key-value pairs for college professor reviews analysis. Various tools (subclasses) allow users to visualize data based on keywords, such as rating distributions, gender-based analyses, and word frequency. A key focus was placed on writing code that could execute within given Big O time restrictions.

Done as part of the 2023 Winter Semester COMP250 course @ McGill Univerity.

Instructor-provided GUI files (launched by running Main.js) which display the results of the data processing, as well as a sample CSV to test the program are included in the repository.
