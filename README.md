# ProfHashTableAnalysis

A custom hash table (MyHashTable.java) to efficiently handle key-value pairs for college professor reviews analysis. Various tools (subclasses) that allow users to visualize data based on keywords, such as rating distributions, gender-based analyses, and word frequency.

Done as part of the 2022 Winter Semester COMP250 course @ McGill Univerity

An instructor-provided GUI displaying the results of the data processing is included in the files.
